# Bookstore 

This is a frontend project. My idea was to create a children's online book store. The Home page has a few detials of the bookstore. In the store page, the books details are shown in the cards. There is an option to search for a particular book among the books. There is also an option to sort the books in alphabetical order and according to pages. I have used google books API for the data. The selected books can be adden and removed from the cart. The cart page shows the list of the books added to the cart. I have used the local storage. The application also has 2 color modes. Light mode and Dark mode.

I have used the following technologies.

ðŸ’Š Used HTML, CSS, React, Redux, TypeScript, Bootstrap, CSS variables.
